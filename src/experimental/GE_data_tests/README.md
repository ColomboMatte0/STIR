README for GE_data_tests in STIR experimental.

The python scripts here are designed to be used with the Jupyter Notebooks. They can be converted into `.ipynb` format using the `p2j` command line utilty, e.g:
	`p2j plot_GE_singles_info.py`,
then open the Jupyter Notebooks with the `jupyter notebook` command.

This directory contains scripts used to investigate the STIR interface with GE list mode data, particually that of `print_GE_singles_values` and `construct_randoms_from_GEsingles`. 

This investigation began becasue `construct_randoms_from_GEsingles` appeared to overestimate the contribution due to randoms. 

Data is not provided for these experiments.
